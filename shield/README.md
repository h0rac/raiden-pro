The raiden SHIELD is an implementation of the power glitching fast switch described here:

https://github.com/AdamLaurie/raiden-pro/blob/main/docs/Schematic_raiden_application_raiden_application_20191208182559.pdf

plus a few extras like connectors for ChipShouter, USB power passthrough (optinally via a Shunt resistor), scope probe points etc.

Unfortunately the first production run failed to print the screenprint layer so nothing is labelled but we are working on an update and a BOM.

The schematic is provided in EasyEDA format.
